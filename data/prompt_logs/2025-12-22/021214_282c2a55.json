Use only facts present in the sender/receiver details or explicitly provided evidence; do not invent relationships, meetings, achievements, or affiliations. If information is missing, keep it generic rather than guessing. Follow this structure: Subject -> opening reason based on receiver evidence -> brief common ground -> value the sender can offer -> one clear ask (with time or a lightweight option) -> polite opt-out -> sign-off.

  "output_generate_email": "Subject: Stanford CS PhD student interested in your AI insights\n\nDear Professor Ng,\n\nAs a Stanford CS PhD student with an interest in AI, I've been following your work at DeepLearning.AI for some time.\n\nLike you, I also studied at Stanford. I am currently exploring different research directions within AI.\n\nGiven your expertise, I was hoping you might be open to a brief chat. I'd be grateful for the chance to get your perspective.\n\nWould you be available for a 15-minute call sometime in the next few weeks? Alternatively, I'd be happy to send over a few specific questions via email if that's easier.\n\nOf course, I understand if you're too busy.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTest User",
